### 2020-2021 School Year  

Our open house will take place on Tuesday, February 4. Bring your child along for a wonderful opportunity to meet the teachers and see the classroom. Parents can learn about the program and ask questions while kids play and complete a craft. Contact our registrar through the "Request Information" button on the home page to let us know that you'd like to attend.

### Winter Break

School will be closed December 20 through January 1 for winter break. Happy Holidays!
