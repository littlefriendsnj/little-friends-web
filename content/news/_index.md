Check out what's happening at Little Friends! 

### Egg hatching project 

The eggs for our much loved egg hatching project will arrive on April 1. 
Our students will be able to observe the eggs and visit with the baby chicks 
as they hatch. This is always an exciting time for our students (and staff)!
